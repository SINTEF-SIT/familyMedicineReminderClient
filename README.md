##Project description##
The [MyCyFAPP project](http://www.mycyfapp.eu/en/) is concerned with helping people who suffer from cystic fibrosis. This piece of software is the client of a suite intended to help people remember taking their medicine, as well as allowing parents or guardians to overview this process. The client was made for the course IT2901 at [NTNU](http://www.ntnu.no) for the Norwegian research organisation [SINTEF](http://www.sintef.no).

This is the Android client for the back-end server [FamilyMedicineReminder](https://github.com/SINTEF-SIT/familyMedicineReminder).
